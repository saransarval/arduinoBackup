Abstract :Passive   Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an emerging technology increasingly   adopted in many contexts, even quite far from the canonical ones basically   related to logistics and product tracking. Identification of goods containing   liquid or made of metal, RFID-based sensor data transmission, monitoring of   small items, are only a few of the many possible examples. Indeed, an RFID   system is a very cost-effective technology allowing the automatic of a   labeled object/animal/person and consists of two a reader (or interrogator)   with energization and interrogation functions and a tag (or transponder)   which is a rather inexpensive and passive device which, once powered by the   reader signal, transmits back its unique identification data (ID).
