based secure access to patient’s
personal data and medical records by using RFID tags and Web
Service with the help of hardware kit. This system uses Web
service interfaces to sup
port standard Electronic Health
Records
for patient record interoper
ability.
Customers can view and
update their personal medical information via the web site,
which seamlessly sync with one another. Because the system is
built on Web services, it is easy to update, adapt and grow.
Trying to identify an unconscious patient
or patient who is
unable to communicate can lead to delays in treatment. With this
system emergency departments improve efficiency while
enhan
cing the level of patient care. This
project uses the
hardware kit to get the patient id. The hardware kit will s
end the
patient id to the serial port of the system. Hence tracking and
monitoring of patients, their case sheets and medical equipments
can be efficiently carried out.
However, the reality of RFID
adoption is
far behind earlier expectation.
This study rev
iews the
literature on RFID applications in healthcare based on a formal
research framework. We aim to identify current opportunities,
potential
benefits and adoption barriers.
Our study shows that
most care providers indicated that RFID to be functional a
nd
useful in asset tracking and patient
identification. Major barriers
to
RFID adoption in healthcare include prohibitive costs,
technological limitations, and privacy concerns. Although RFID
offers healthcare practitioners advantages to enhance clinical
p
ractice, better designed RFID systems are needed to increase
