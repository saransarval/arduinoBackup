In a health care context, the use RFID (radio frequency identification) technology can be employed for not only bringing down health care costs but also facilitate automating and streamlining patient identification processes in hospitals and use of mobile devices like PDA, smart phones, for design a health care management systems. In this paper, we outline a RFID model for designing a system in the health care. An application of the architecture is described in the area of RFID-based real-time hospital patient management system (HPMS).
